As you progress in learning to program, youâ€™ll move from essential programming elements to important programming elements. Selection (if) and repetition (while) are essential programming constructs. It is difficult to write anyprogram without using these two essential features. Functions, on the other hand, allow us to write better code in the sense that it is more readable. Also, because functions allow us to divide programs into smaller pieces, they assist in divide-and-conquer problem solving. In that way, functions make programs easier to write. Finally, once a function is written, it can be shared and used by other programmers (including ourselves). Thus, functions provide a powerful construct that we can use to make our programs easier to read, write, and maintain.
