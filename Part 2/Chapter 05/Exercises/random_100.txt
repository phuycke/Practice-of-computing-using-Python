We now have a partial program that calculates the 
probability of getting a poker hand with just one pair. 
To complete the program, we must include a counter for each type of hand. 
We need a counter for each type of hand, and we need to increment that 
counter each time that type of hand is encountered. 
The resulting program is quite a bit longer, but if you examine 
it carefully, you will see that we simply duplicated the counter 
initialization and increment statements. (Later, you will learn how 
to write a more compact program with one compound counter as a list 
to accommodate all 10 types of hands.)
